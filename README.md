# Hedwig Dashboard

## Welcome!
This is a project working with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). I've also used [Material UI](https://mui.com/) and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). All the data is taken by the [Hedwig API (See documentation)](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/AlanRacciatti/Hedwig-api/1.0.1)

## Installation and usage

Then you can just run the project
